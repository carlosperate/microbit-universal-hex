# Universal Hex Format

The micro:bit Universal Hex format is a superset of the
[Intel Hex file format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_HEX) designed to be
able to include data for multiple targets into a single file.

This section of the docs is still a Work In Progress. For detailed information
